You can learn to get background location information using react-native-background-geolocation, display information using react-native-maps, and handle photo libraries using react-native-camera-roll.

# Features

You can work with Django REST Framework and even store data retrieved by react-native-background-geolocation through the API.
You can manually set the location in the app even if the photo does not have location information attached to it.
